Prince Jeff!
There you are I was worried about you!
Your mother... Queen Josephine she has fallen gravely ill! I have seen this before, Its not a good sign.
This isn't any ordinary illness, we believe she was poisoned with an extremely advanced concoction.
Fortunetly we believe there might exist a cure!
From what we know the trials to gather these ingredients would be extremely dangerous. 
But if these ingredients can be found we may have a high chance of saving her life
Unfortunetly Prince Julius.. your brother is still absent from court, waging war with our neighbouring kingdoms.
So YOU! will need to find the three mythical herbs so we can create an antidote.
You will find the first herb west of the castle in the Jade Forest.
Please Prince Jeff you are the only one left who can do this. 
Swiftly gather all of these herbs the Queens life depends on it!
