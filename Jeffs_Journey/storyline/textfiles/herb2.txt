Prince Jeff we are pleased you have finally arrived back.
You have done a excellent job retrieving the second mythical herb.
The scouts we have sent to locate your brother have returned!
But they come baring terrible news. 
They have been unable to locate your brother and fair that he may have also fallen in the hands of this ruthless assassin.
If Queen Josephine is unable to recover and Prince Julius missing in action the kingdom will certainly suffer greatly.
Queen Josephine is almost out of time and must be saved at all costs!
The final herb is told to be found in the Jettatura Caves which is loacted by following the last remaining road out of town.
Please rush to recover the last mythical herb before it is all to late!!!
