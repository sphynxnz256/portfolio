Hello brother...
Why do you have to be so troublesome and interfere with my plans!
Things would have been much easier if you had just stayed in the castle and just let her die.
But now you have forced my hand and I must step in to stop you.
Our mother was a weak and cowardly ruler, the Alexander Empire deserves to prosper, under the right ruler... ME.
I wont let you deliver those herbs to save mother, even if it kills me!!!
PREPARE TO FIGHT!!!
