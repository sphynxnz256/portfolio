This repo is a collection of my work while studying for a Bachelor of Applied Information Technology

--C# Project--


-Animal Program-

This was my first full app. It was intended to show of basic stuff like use of classes and inheritance, hashtables, reading from databases etc.



--Android Projects(java/XML)--


-Gym App-

This was my first ever mobile app. It basically lets you make workouts and then add exercises to that workout and then stores everything in a database. There is one flaw to it though. I'm not sure I got the relationships linked correctly in the database and I suspect that if you delete all workouts, the related child exercises dont get deleted. Overall though I was pretty happy with this since it was my first ever app.


-Waiata App-

This app was a group project. The parts I was responsible for were the carvings page. The fragments and related functionality and due to this app being built before I knew how to use version control, I was also resonsible for taking all the code my group wrote and making it work together. That was a fun learning experience where I learned why version control is so useful.



--Godot Projects(GD Script)--


-Dangerous Dag-

This was a project where I had to build a couple of levels for a class game. It's far from perfect and was my first attempt at building a game (or atleast part of one).


-Tank Game-

This was game I built following a tutorial by KidsCanCode that I found on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ1FpD0DYF8&list=PLsk-HSGFjnaFC8kEv6MaLXnnDcevGpSWf&ab_channel=KidsCanCode. Even tho I was following a tutorial it still took a bit of learning to do and im still pretty proud of the work I did.


-Jeff's Journey-

This was a group project I was part of building. The parts I worked on were the title screen, death screen, lake levels, ui design, and the xp system. Unfotunately we never got the final boss level implimented but some of the code is still in there. There were other things that could have been done a lot better as well. After showing the game to friends and seeing how they played it, I saw a number of places where the game could be made better. However I want to move on to a new solo hobby project so I probably wont go back and fix this up.
